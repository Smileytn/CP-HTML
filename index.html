        <p>Welcome to my first webpage, as a cat it is hard for me to use the keyboard properly so bare with the typos.
          if there is any, it's the hooman being lazy not me.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi my name is Orange or "بردقانة" in arabic, I prefer the latter because is sounds cooler. My mother Yuumi gave birth to me three months ago under a sink in my CASTLE that happens to house a few unnescessary hoomans but who cares they can live here as long as they serve me well.
           Anyways, here's a picture of me. <br>

        <h1>Work</h1>
        <p>"I dont work I'm a prince" Thats my life, infact remember those hoomans I mentioned in the beginning? Yes they work for me. I have to share my castle with one particular hooman for most of the day cause he's retired whatever that means.
          The others usually leave in the morning and come back in the evening so I get to do whatever the hell I want. I always aspired to become a wrestler though here's a video of me sparing with my mom. <br>

          I didnt say I was a professional wrestler or anything but you can clearly see that I won that!
